# customer_behavior_analysis
Data analytics project showcasing customer behavior analysis using Python, SQL and Power BI
This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics workflow, starting from raw data loading to insights visualization and reporting. The goal of this project is to analyze a dataset using Python and SQL, generate meaningful insights, and present them through an interactive Power BI dashboard and a professional presentation.

This project showcases practical skills required for Data Analyst / Data Science roles, including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), SQL querying, dashboard building, and reporting.
